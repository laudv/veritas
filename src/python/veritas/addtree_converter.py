    Interface that gives the opportunity to implement a conversion from one's own model to Veritas' represention of tree ensembles.
    The function to implement is ``get_addtree(model)``. The converter then needs to be added to the convertermanager using ``add_addtree_converter()``.
    For an example see :ref:`Model Conversion implementation`.
